			<h3>Our Services</h3>

<p>From a single table of 10 Players to 1,000 Players or more we can cope with any number. We execute full professional international tournaments and local charity games on a regular basis. They are great fun and we have over ten years experience so you are using a tried and tested company with Pokerireland.ie.</p>


<h3>Here\'s how it works</h3>

<p>
<ol>

<li> You call us and tell us what you want, how many players you expect and where you want to hold the event.</li>
<li>We agree to come, with professional poker dealers (if required), tables, chips, cards and everything else necessary to run the tournament.</li>
<li>You have a great night. We organize everything, so you can enjoy the fun.</li>
<li>If you require us to advertise your tournament, in order to attract extra poker players then we can distribute information to a database of thousands of active poker players around Ireland, the UK, Europe, USA and all over the world.</li>
</ol>

</p>

<h3>Cost</h3>
<p>
Ok, so how much is all this going to cost? Presuming you want a professional event played using a standard blind structure and time scale our fee starts at â‚¬500 (incl Vat) for the smallest events (approx 100 players)...Pricing for larger events are by quotation and agreement. All Dealers are professionally trained. Rules are as per TDA unless otherwise specified at a particular event.</p>

<p>If you don\'t have your own venue, we can arrange that too and can get preferential rates with many hotels and conference centres.</p>


<h3>Fund raising for charity ?</h3>
<p>No problem. We will show you how to manage and raise funds. We can make your flyers, post notices on the web, manage social media and other publicity channels and generally advise on how to advertise and promote your event so as to maximize the return for your charity or sports club.</p>
<p>
We can also arrange for no cash to be held on the premises on the night of a given event, all players can register with us directly using our secure payment gateway.
</p>

<h3>Corporate or team building events?</h3>
<p>No problem. We have years of experience in this area and can run a fun professional game for any number of employees or friends.</p>
