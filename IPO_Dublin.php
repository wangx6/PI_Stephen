		The <a href="http://www.boylepoker.com" target="_blank">Boylepoker.com</a> International Poker Open Dublin 2014 is now well established as one of the most exciting and best value poker tournaments in Europe. This year promises to be bigger and better than ever before with extra seats being sold to French players especially. Our record to date is 1,440 individual players but we are aiming to beat that number so we need every poker player in Europe to get involved.

        <p>
The Regency Hotel, close to Dublin Airport and Dublin City Centre has been the venue of the Boylepoker.com IPO Dublin since 2007 and offers players great poker rate accommodation, good value food and a lively atmosphere at the bar is a guarantee.
The IPO Dublin 2014 is a Re-Entry event, players who are knocked out will have the option to re-enter on the following day so if you are knocked out on Day 1A you can re-enter on Day 1B or Day 1C (N.B. Re-entry on the same starting day is not allowed so players starting on Day 1C cannot re-enter).
