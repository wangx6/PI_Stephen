		The <a href="http://boylepoker.com" target="_blank">Boylepoker.com</a> International Poker Open Newcastle 2014 is gaining huge interest across the UK and Europe. The event, which is the first ever IPO in Newcastle takes place in Aspers Casino, Newcastle, UK.
Aspers Casino have already hosted two successful Boylepoker.com IPO events in London and this event will mark further expansion of the Boylepoker.com IPO Tour. We’re expecting a huge turnout of players and we are encouraging players to support this event to make it a regular mainstay on the UK poker calendar.
The IPO Newcastle 2014 is a Re-Entry event, players who are knocked out will have the option to re-enter on the following day so if you are knocked out on Day 1A you can re-enter on Day 1B or Day 1C (N.B. Re-entry on the same starting day is not allowed so players starting on Day 1C cannot re-enter).
